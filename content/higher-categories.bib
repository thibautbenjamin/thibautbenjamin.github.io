  abstract = { The ability to cast values between related types is a
                  leitmotiv of many flavors of dependent type theory,
                  such as observational type theories, subtyping, or
                  cast calculi for gradual typing. These casts all
                  exhibit a common structural behavior that boils down
                  to the pervasive functoriality of type formers. We
                  propose and extensively study a type theory, called
                  AdapTT, which makes systematic and precise this idea
                  of functorial type formers, with respect to an
                  abstract notion of adapters relating types.
                  Leveraging descriptions for functorial inductive
                  types in AdapTT, we derive structural laws for type
                  casts on general inductive type formers. },

                  with a directed interval, and behaves logically as a
                  globular analogue of Reynolds parametricity. Our

                  cylinders and cones in omega-categories. The
                  machinery can generate terms of high complexity, and
                  we have implemented our construction in a proof

                  their higher identity types form weak
                  omega-groupoids, so they are in particular weak

                  omega-category as an operation on higher identity
                  types. We then illustrate how this translation

                  ω-categories, and we formalise this theory in the
                  language of homotopy type theory. Most of the
                  studies about this type theory assume that it is
                  well-formed and satisfy the usual syntactic
                  properties that dependent type theories enjoy,
                  without being completely clear and thorough about
                  what these properties are exactly. We use the
                  formalisation that we provide to list and formally
                  prove all of these meta-properties, thus filling a
                  gap in the foundational aspect. We discuss the key
                  aspects of the formalisation inherent to the theory
                  CaTT, in particular that the absence of definitional
                  equality greatly simplify the study, but also that
                  specific side conditions are challenging to properly
                  model. We present the formalisation in a way that
                  not only handles the type theory CaTT but also all
                  the related type theories that share the same
                  structure, and in particular we show that this

                  of the theory MCaTT which describes the globular,

  abstract={Weak ω-categories are notoriously difficult to define
                  because of the very intricate nature of their
                  axioms. Various approaches have been explored based
                  on different shapes given to the cells.
                  Interestingly, homotopy type theory encompasses a
                  definition of weak ω-groupoid in a globular setting,
                  since every type carries such a structure. Starting
                  from this remark, Brunerie could extract this
                  definition of globular weak ω-groupoids, formulated
                  as a type theory. By refining its rules, Finster and
                  Mimram have then defined a type theory called 𝖢𝖺𝖳𝖳 ,
                  whose models are weak ω-categories. Here, we
                  generalize this approach to monoidal weak
                  ω-categories. Based on the principle that they
                  should be equivalent to weak ω-categories with only
                  one 0-cell, we are able to derive a type theory
                  𝖬𝖢𝖺𝖳𝖳 whose models are monoidal weak ω-categories.
                  This requires changing the rules of the theory in
                  order to encode the information carried by the
                  unique 0-cell. The correctness of the resulting type
                  theory is shown by defining a pair of translations
                  between our type theory 𝖬𝖢𝖺𝖳𝖳 and the type theory
                  𝖢𝖺𝖳𝖳 . Our main contribution is to show that these
                  translations relate the models of our type theory to
                  the models of the type theory 𝖢𝖺𝖳𝖳 consisting of
                  ω-categories with only one 0-cell by analyzing in
                  details how the notion of models interact with the
                  structural rules of both type theories.},

                  ω-categories, as defined by Maltsiniotis, by
                  generalizing a definition proposed by Grothendieck
                  for weak ω-groupoids: those are defined as suitable
                  presheaves over a cat-coherator, which is a category

                  les définitions qui en ont été proposées à ce jour à
                  ce jour restent difficiles à manipuler en pratique :
                  on ne connaît pas de liste explicite des cohérences

                  devient rapidement difficile de vérifier tous les
                  détails qui doivent l’être lors de leur utilisation.
                  Partant de ce constat, Finster et Mimram ont
                  récemment reformulé la définition de Grothendieck et

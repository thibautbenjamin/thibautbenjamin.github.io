                  œâ-categories. We use the inductive presentation of
                  weak œâ-categories via an adjunction with the
                  categroy of computads, and show that invertible

                  œâ-categories. Moreover, we give a simple criterion
                  for invertibility in computads, together with an
                  algorithm computing the data witnessing the
                  invertibility, including the inverse, and the
                  cancellation data. },

  abstract={Two novel descriptions of weak œâ-categories have been
                  recently proposed, using type-theoretic ideas. The
                  first one is the dependent type theory CaTT whose
                  models are œâ-categories. The second is a recursive
                  description of a category of computads together with
                  an adjunction to globular sets, such that the
                  algebras for the induced monad are again
                  œâ-categories. We compare the two descriptions by
                  showing that there exits a fully faithful morphism
                  of categories with families from the syntactic
                  category of CaTT to the opposite of the category of
                  computads, which gives an equivalence on the
                  subcategory of finite computads. We derive a more
                  direct connection between the category of models of
                  CaTT and the category of algebras for the monad on
                  globular sets, induced by the adjunction with
                  computads. },

  abstract={We present the type theory CaTT, originally introduced by Finster and Mimram to describe globular weak omega-categories,
    and we formalise this theory in the language of homotopy type theory. Most of the studies about this type theory assume that it is
    well-formed and satisfy the usual syntactic properties that dependent type theories enjoy, without being completely clear and
    thorough about what these properties are exactly. We use the formalisation that we provide to list and formally prove all of
    these meta-properties, thus filling a gap in the foundational aspect. We discuss the key aspects of the formalisation inherent
    to the theory CaTT, in particular that the absence of definitional equality greatly simplify the study, but also that specific
    side conditions are challenging to properly model. We present the formalisation in a way that not only handles the type theory
    CaTT but also all the related type theories that share the same structure, and in particular we show that this formalisation
    provides a proper ground to the study of the theory MCaTT which describes the globular, monoidal weak omega-categories. The article
    is accompanied by a development in the proof assistant Agda to actually check the formalisation that we present. },

  abstract={Weak omega-categories are notoriously difficult to define because of the very intricate nature of their axioms.
    Various approaches have been explored based on different shapes given to the cells. Interestingly, homotopy type theory encompasses a definition of
    weak omega-groupoid in a globular setting, since every type carries such a structure. Starting from this remark, Brunerie could extract this
    definition of globular weak omega-groupoids, formulated as a type theory. By refining its rules, Finster and Mimram have then defined a type
    theory called ùñ¢ùñ∫ùñ≥ùñ≥ , whose models are weak omega-categories. Here, we generalize this approach to monoidal weak omega-categories.
    Based on the principle that they should be equivalent to weak omega-categories with only one 0-cell, we are able to derive a type theory ùñ¨ùñ¢ùñ∫ùñ≥ùñ≥
    whose models are monoidal weak omega-categories. This requires changing the rules of the theory in order to encode the information carried by
    the unique 0-cell. The correctness of the resulting type theory is shown by defining a pair of translations between our type theory ùñ¨ùñ¢ùñ∫ùñ≥ùñ≥
    and the type theory ùñ¢ùñ∫ùñ≥ùñ≥ . Our main contribution is to show that these translations relate the models of our type theory to the models of
    the type theory ùñ¢ùñ∫ùñ≥ùñ≥ consisting of omega-categories with only one 0-cell by analyzing in details how the notion of models interact with
    the structural rules of both type theories.},

  abstract={We study the dependent type theory CaTT, introduced by Finster and Mimram, which presents the theory of weak omega-categories,
    following the idea that type theories can be considered as presentations of generalized algebraic theories. Our main contribution is a
    formal proof that the models of this type theory correspond precisely to weak omega-categories, as defined by Maltsiniotis, by generalizing
    a definition proposed by Grothendieck for weak omega-groupoids: those are defined as suitable presheaves over a cat-coherator,
    which is a category encoding structure expected to be found in an omega-category. This comparison is established by proving
    the initiality conjecture for the type theory CaTT, in a way which suggests the possible generalization to a nerve theorem for
    a certain class of dependent type theories},

  abstract={La notion de omega-cat√©gorie faible est une vaste g√©n√©ralisation de celle de cat√©gorie, qui rev√™t une importance croissante en math√©matiques.
    Cependant, les d√©finitions qui en ont √©t√© propos√©es √† ce jour √† ce jour restent difficiles √† manipuler en pratique : on ne conna√Æt
    pas de liste explicite des coh√©rences qui doivent √™tre pr√©sentes dans ces structures et il devient rapidement difficile de v√©rifier
    tous les d√©tails qui doivent l‚Äô√™tre lors de leur utilisation. Partant de ce constat, Finster et Mimram ont r√©cemment reformul√© la d√©finition
    de Grothendieck et Maltsiniotis des omega-cat√©gories faibles sous forme d‚Äôune th√©orie des types, appel√©e CaTT. Ceci a pos√© les bases
    d‚Äôun assistant de preuve, d√©velopp√© par les auteurs, dans lequel les termes typables sont ceux qui correspondent √† des coh√©rences.
    La formalisation de preuves non-triviales dans ce syst√®me a montr√© la n√©cessit√© d‚Äôavoir des outils permettant de les automatiser
    en partie. Dans cette optique, nous pr√©sentons ici deux m√©thodes permettant de g√©n√©rer automatiquement des coh√©rences de
    dimension sup√©rieure √† partir de coh√©rences existantes : la suspension et la fonctorialit√©. Nous montrons qu‚Äôelles sont
    admissibles (c‚Äôest-√†-dire que leur pr√©sence ne modifie pas le pouvoir expressif de la th√©orie des types) et qu‚Äôelles sont utiles en
    pratique pour all√©ger les preuves en √©vitant des redondances.},

* Scientific Notes

You can find here a collection of my scientific notes. This are mostly
personal notes about various topics of interest to me. It can be
topics that I am learning and formulating in a way that suits me, some
work that I made and wish to keep, intuitions that I am building and
more or less vague ideas. They do not aim at being very polished, but
I hope that they can be an interesting resource for others trying to
approach the same topics.
